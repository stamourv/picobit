This is a very small Scheme system designed to run on small
microcontrollers, currently the PIC microcontroller.

It consists of

* a bytecode compiler which compiles Scheme source code to bytecode.
  The bytecode compiler is run using the Gambit-C Scheme system,
  usually on a PC/workstation.

* a bytecode interpreter which can be either compiled to run on a
  microcontroller, or to be run on some common operating systems, at
  least GNU/Linux (Windows support hasn't been tested in a while,
  though, and especially the networking part might not work out of the
  box).


USAGE:

1. Install the dependencies:

  * Gambit-C: needed to run the bytecode compiler.
    See http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/

  * libpcap: optional, to test networking on PC's (GNU/Linux)
    Be sure to also install the package containing the headers
    (libpcap-dev or similar).
    (TODO: add to makefile somehow)

2a. Targetting a PC/workstation for testing:

  * Build the VM: run
     make

  * Compile and run a Scheme program: run
     ./p schemefile

2b. Compile and run a Scheme program on PIC:

  <TODO>

 and maybe you find the papers about the BIT and PICBIT systems
 interesting, which have been written before PICOBIT and share some
 common concepts:
